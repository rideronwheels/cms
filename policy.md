						<p>
							
								
								We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

						<h3 class="card-title">Website Visitors.</h3>
						<p>
								
								Like most website operators, Trow collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Trow's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Trow's visitors use its website. From time to time, Trow may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
								<br><br>
								Trow also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.trow.online blog posts. Trow only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
							</p>
						<h3 class="card-title">Security.</h3>
						<p>
								
								The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
						</p>
						<h3 class="card-title">Advertisements.</h3>
						<p>
								
								Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Trow and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
						</p>
						<h3 class="card-title">Links To External Sites.</h3>
						<p>
								
								Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
						<br><br>

Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
