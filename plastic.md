						<b>#carryownbottle</b> is a small initiative to spread awareness among travellers to reduce the consumption of plastic bottles.

						Recently we have seen news like - ‘China's Everest cleanup rakes in 8.5 tonnes of garbage’, 
						‘Oceans are choked by plastic bottles’ etc. Plastic wastes are getting accumulated from the sea to the highest point on earth, i.e, wherever humans are reaching they are leaving some footprints, that is harmful to earth. Who else reaches on the top of everest and deep into oceans?? Yes, it is us - the travellers.

						What are these waste ? It can be food wastes, plastic etc. Here we are talking about the most dangerous one - The Plastic.

						As travellers, we all know water is an important thing to carry while travelling. Some people carry in bottles, some in cans and some buy from outside. Most of the people buy bottled water from outside because that is the easiest way. We can buy it for 20 rupees,use it and leave the bottle somewhere - what an easy way !!

						<b>Think deep !!</b>

						Let’s take an example of a family of 4 members in a one month tour. Considering an average usage, they will need at least 4 bottles in a day and 120 bottles in a month, these are nothing but waste. If this is a case for a 4 member family in one month trip, think about the whole world. 

						As per studies, a million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number will jump another 20% by 2021. Fewer than half of the bottles bought in 2016 were collected for recycling and just 7% of those collected were turned into new bottles.Instead most plastic bottles produced end up in landfill or in the ocean.

						<b>The hidden side</b>

						The hidden part regarding bottled waters are, nobody knows the source.

						India is among the 10 largest bottled water consumers in the world. Seconding this, Indian bottled water industry is growing like anything and multiple MNCs and individuals are moving to expand their business here.  There are thousands of brands in India and according to a national level study, 80% brands are local brands. Leave alone the metros, where a bottled-water manufacturer can be found even in a one-room shop, in every medium and small city and even in some prosperous rural areas there are bottled water manufacturers.

						We don't know from where it comes, we dont know the quality but we are used to do this - we buy, we use  and at the end we throw it somewhere. So it is high time to rethink about what we are doing and is that really required ?

						<b>Our Own Bottle</b>

						What if we stop using bottled water and start carrying our own bottles ? 

						A good water bottle will last minimum 3 years. Think how many plastic bottles can be replaced with this single water bottle. We can carry water from home and if it gets over we can refill from any hotels. If quality of water comes in to mind, bottles with purifiers are available in the market.

						<b>Our Pledge -  Carry Own Bottle</b>

						As part of being the change for a greener tomorrow we are taking a pledge to reduce plastic consumption. In our trips we will be carrying our own water bottles instead of mineral water bottles.
